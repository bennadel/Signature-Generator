# Document Signature Generator

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

I recently had to "sign" a PDF. And, the author didn't provide it as a DocuSign (or any other digital signature format). As such, I had to annotate the PDF with a **signature image**. And, I needed a way to generate the signature. So, I decided to play around with using [hand-written Google Fonts][google-fonts] and [html2cavnas][html2cavnas] to generate transparent PNG images of various signature styles.
